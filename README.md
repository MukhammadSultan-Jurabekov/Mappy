# Universal Map with Weather and Interactive Features
### This project is a web-based map application built with Leaflet.js and integrates with the Open-Meteo weather API. The application allows users to view weather information by clicking on any location on the map. Additionally, it provides interactive features such as markers for points of interest and real-time event information.

# Features
Map Layers: The map uses OpenStreetMap as the base layer.
Weather Data: Clicking anywhere on the map fetches current weather data for the selected location using the Open-Meteo API.
Temperature (Â°C)
Wind Speed (km/h)
Wind Direction
Precipitation (mm)
Points of Interest: The map includes interactive markers for key landmarks, such as the Eiffel Tower.
Real-Time Events: Markers display information about current events, such as concerts, and can be dynamically updated.
Animated Traffic Simulation: A simple simulation of real-time traffic is implemented using a polyline that moves along predefined coordinates.
How to Use
Prerequisites
A modern web browser.
Basic knowledge of HTML, JavaScript, and APIs.
No need for backend services; everything runs in the browser.
Running the Project
Clone the repository or download the files to your local machine.

```
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/universal-map-weather.git
```

Open the index.html file in your preferred web browser.

To view weather data, click on any location on the map, and a popup will display the current temperature, wind speed, wind direction, and precipitation for that area.

Weather API
This project uses the Open-Meteo API to fetch weather data based on geographical coordinates. The API provides current weather data, such as temperature, wind speed, and precipitation.

To use your own API key for the weather:

Replace the URL inside the getWeather function in the JavaScript with your custom API key and parameters if needed.
Customization
You can add more points of interest by adding new markers using Leaflet's L.marker method.
Update the getWeather function to include additional weather parameters from the Open-Meteo API, such as humidity or cloud cover.
